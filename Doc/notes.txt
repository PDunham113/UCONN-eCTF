Use internal Clock instead 
Modify clock rate randomly with timers
Can we use external chips for defense
Generate some randomness with clock jitter
Store quality randomness then pull out later with clock jitter
Use ADC for randomness
Fuses hard to change
Lock bits also hard to change

Are there timing/power restrictions. MEH
We can use RC oscillator YES
Versioning is guarented >||<
Can we physically modify the chips in the attack phase. YES


Attacks:
Brownout attacks are rather easy
power side channel isn't that difficult, details not all yet known



We do analysis on code compiled and source, but when we find an attack we recquisition a charged chip with flags
*secret* not shared
Different builds should generate different keys



power analysis attacks revealing the secrets of smart cards

CMAC Auth
read !key and key expanding the nibble
Erase flash with data
Use counter to change IV
	Server side needs this
	Write to EEPROM
